<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
  Base characters are humans and they all have the same three attributes: Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. These attributes are set initially by rolling 4d6 (Four 6 sided dice), removing the lowest value and average the rest, rounded down. After rolling for three stats, assign them to the attributes of your choice.
</p>

<p>
  These three stats all contribute to player health. Whenever a player takes damage they must subtract the damage from stats of their choice, unless told otherwise. If all three stats reach zero, the character is dead.
