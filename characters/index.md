## Character Creation

Base characters are humans and they all have the same three attributes: Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. These attributes are set initially by rolling 4d6 (Four 6 sided dice), removing the lowest value and average the rest, rounded down. After rolling for three stats, assign them to the attributes of your choice.

These three stats all contribute to player health. Whenever a player takes damage they must subtract the damage from stats of their choice, unless told otherwise. If all three stats reach zero, the character is dead.
