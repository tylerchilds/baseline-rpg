## Creatures
The bestiary is only a suggestion based on common enemies. Enemies will have different levels. For each level the enemy is below the character, subtract the difference from the enemy’s attack and defensive rolls. For each level the enemy is above the character, add the difference to the enemy’s attack and defensive rolls.
